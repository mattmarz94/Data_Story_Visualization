# Tableau Data Story Visualizaion : Project Overview

This project, **Rooted in Equity: Mapping Pittsburgh’s Urban Tree Benefits and Opportunities**, serves as the final data story assignment for my Art of Data Visualization course.
My goal was to use data-driven visual storytelling to examine how environmental and economic benefits of Pittsburgh’s urban forest are distributed across neighborhoods, and to highlight inequities that can guide future tree-planting and maintenance strategies.

**Tableau Public**

All five final visualizations were built using Tableau Public. Tableau allowed me to create both intuitive static graphics and fully interactive experiences, aligning with course objectives for leveraging interactivity, design principles, and user-centered communication.

While my final story was constructed in Tableau, a substantial portion of the course involved:

* GeoPandas, Folium, Shapely, GeoDatasets: Used for understanding geospatial data, choropleths, interactive maps, color scales, unified scaling, and spatial filtering.

* Matplotlib for map rendering

* Tableau mapping workflows for geographic roles, symbol maps, choropleths, and density maps.

I drew directly from these skills to interpret spatial patterns in the tree inventory before designing final visuals in Tableau.

## Visualizations Included

My story includes five visualizations:

1. Geographic Benefit Map

Shows unequal tree-related environmental/economic benefits across neighborhoods.
Demonstrates spatial clustering of high-benefit areas vs underserved regions.

2. Species Diversity Bar Chart

Reveals dependency on several dominant species and highlights biodiversity vulnerabilities.

3. Electricity Savings Word Cloud

Communicates energy-saving inequities in a visually immediate way.

4. Tree Condition Bar Chart

Shows health distribution of trees, emphasizing maintenance needs and safety concerns.

5. Equity Comparison Scatter Plot

Identifies neighborhoods that are simultaneously low in tree count and low in per-tree benefits.

Each visualization addresses a different facet of Pittsburgh’s urban forest equity problem while collectively reinforcing the main message.


## What I Learned

Throughout this project and the course, I learned to:

* Build meaningful visualizations that apply deliberate design principles

Color, contrast, scale, and layout communicate as much as the data itself.

* Transform geospatial data into analytic visuals

Understanding spatial data structure was crucial for mapping tree benefits accurately.

* Use Tableau Public as a storytelling platform

Interactivity significantly enhances insight discovery and audience engagement.

* Evaluate visualizations using a data-story rubric

I designed my submission to meet:

Appropriate plot selection

Clear labels, scales, legends

Good readability and design ethics

Varied plot types exploring different patterns

A cohesive narrative that ties all visuals together

* Translate complex environmental data into actionable insights

Tree benefits are multifaceted. They can impact energy savings, stormwater mitigation, air quality, and using visualization helps uncover inequities that are otherwise difficult to see.
